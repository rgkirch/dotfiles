fresh install of manjaro with old home
there wasn't a 50-synaptic.conf in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d and synclient wasn't installed so I installed xf86-input-synaptics and copied something to 50-synaptic.conf
$ sudo cp ~/50-synaptic.conf /X11/xorg.conf.d
$ install xf86-input-synaptics
vim doesn't have clipboard
